# Pushswap by ikerpacheco

The objective of this project was to sort a list (list_a) of numbers. To achieve this, the developer must use two lists (list_a with numbers, list_b empty) and some instructions to change numbers between lists.

### HOW TO RUN

- Clone the repository.
- Compile the program by typing "make re".
- Execute it by typing "./push_swap" and a list of numbers to sort.
- The program will retrun the list of operations to sort list_a using both lists.

### OPERATIONS

These operations were not coded, we had to code each one of it!

### RESULT

The program will return the operations to sort list_a using both lists. I encourage you to do it manually and check that the program is working!
